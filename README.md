## Overview

We've developed a restaurant website designed for easy online ordering, table reservations, and efficient management, as part of our graduation project. The website allows customers to easily place orders and make table reservations online. At the same time, it provides restaurant owners with a simple and efficient way to manage these orders and reservations, along with dynamically updating content like menus, images, text content and special offers. To achieve this, we've integrated modern technologies such as Socket.io for real-time interactions, tRPC and Prisma for a robust backend, and Next.js, React, Sanity, and TypeScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Built with Socket.io for live communication.
- **Dynamic CMS**: Powered by Sanity for easy content management.
- **Order and Reservation System**: Online food ordering and table reservation capabilities.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with React and Mantine.
- **Robust Backend**: Integrated with tRPC and Prisma.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensuring code reliability.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Implemented with Next.js for improved performance and SEO.
